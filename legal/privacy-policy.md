## How Do We Store Your Data?
This application stores data on a personal home server in Canada. User data is stored in an encrypted database, which is stored on a password protected computer. Data should not be reachable by others outside of those who operate this application.

Backups, which consist of the encrypted database, are stored through Google Drive. These backups occur every hour, although this is subject to change without notice. These backups are kept indefinitely until no longer needed.

While we strive for the best security possible, absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. As stated in our Terms of Service, we are not liable for damages.

Data is kept until it is no longer necessary for the usages described above.
