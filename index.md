# Project Status
NotifHy was made before Hypixel clearly defined the rules of their API. Now, this bot violates the rules established at https://api.hypixel.net/. For this reason, this project has been (somewhat) abandoned, and no more features will be added. The public bot that once hosted an instance of NotifHy has been deleted. This site has been scrubbed, and emails, invites, etc have been replaced with example text.

# About NotifHy
NotifHy is a notification bot for Hypixel. Share logins with friends, get reminders to claim daily rewards, and get alerts on suspicious activity.

## Features
- Simple, friendly, and easy-to-use interfaces
- Minimal Discord permissions and scopes required
- Quick and responsive notifications

## Modules
Modules are how different types of notifications are separated. Once you register, simply select and configure the modules you want to use.
- The Defender Module is an implementation of HyGuard
- The Friends Module sends your login and logouts to a channel to share
- The Rewards Module sends you a DM reminding you to claim your daily reward

## HyGuard
This bot is the successor to HyGuard, which you can read about [here](https://hypixel.net/threads/discord-bot-hyguard-a-bot-that-monitors-your-account-24-7.4368395/ "Hypixel Forums").
- NotifHy now offers different types of notification as explained above
- Some functions or commands were removed because they were badly implemented and now understood to be impractical, such as any function or command utilizing a user's timezone
- Data is now tracked, so you can view your history with **/data**
- Configuring what kind of notifications you get have gone from 6+ different commands to **/modules**
